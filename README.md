# PINNs-SlopeStability-MultiLayer
PINNs use deep learning to solve PDEs, making them mesh-free and flexible for multi-layered soils. They require extensive training but can leverage GPUs for faster performance. FEM relies on domain discretization with high accuracy but can be computationally expensive for complex geometries and meshes.
